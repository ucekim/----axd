# EGaDS! Open Project

Hello! Welcome to the **EGaDS! Open Project**: an open source project where anyone can contribute to the same game. Whether you're an artist, a designer, a programmer, a musician, or just curious about what goes into the development of a game, you can check out the project at any point in its development and help the combined effort to finish the game. No prior experience is required and we welcome beginners! This is a great way for you to learn more about game development and it will give you experience working on a larger team over a longer timeline. 

The event will last from the **17th of June until the 19th of July**, and once the game is complete we will upload it on itch! 

Join the project's [discord](https://discord.gg/XH2cfzdeNJ) for more information.
